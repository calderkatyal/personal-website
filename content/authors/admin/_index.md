      Used advanced computer vision techniques and frameworks (PyTorch) to find a scale-invariant, Markovian state space representation of cooking. Synthesized a massive dataset with thousands of multimodal data points augmented with auto-generated labels via LLMs, trained a state-of-the-art visual classifier for food using transfer learning and contrastive learning techniques. Developed GPU and RAM optimized code to train model given limited compute; adapted real-world data (blurry and disorganized unlabeled video footage, incomprehensible machine-generated cooking logs, etc.) to structured formats using data augmentation and preprocessing techniques. Developed novel model architectures incorporating CNN and transformer-based components. Discussed ideas with CloudChef engineers (top IIT graduates) and implemented the solutions independently.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
