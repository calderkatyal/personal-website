summary: A web application to perform A/B testing that leverages Bayesian methods as well as Flask, Python, and PyMC3 for statistical analysis. Users can input trial and success data for two variants, and the app models and compares their performance. It provides probabilities showing which variant is likely to perform better, along with visualizations of the results. The app is a useful tool for making data-driven decisions in experiments, product testing, and marketing campaigns
