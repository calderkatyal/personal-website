title: Subjectivity Analysis
date: 2024-03-12
description: An interactive subjectivity analysis tool developed in Python, using Natural Language Processing (NLP) to classify sentences into subjective or objective categories while adapting through user feedback. The tool is powered by a Naive Bayes classifier trained on NLTKâ€™s subjectivity dataset, with the ability to adapt and improve based on user feedback. Users can input sentences for classification, and if the prediction is incorrect, they can provide the correct label to refine the model over time. This makes the tool useful for tasks like text analysis, sentiment evaluation, and automated content moderation, while continuously learning and improving from new data.
